# Rocket Elevators Digital Presence - LOÏC RICO

Hi! This is the result of hours of works. The project **RocketElevatorsDigitalPresence** is the result of Genesis, the first two week of the cohort made by [CodeBoxx](https://codeboxx.biz/), to put it simply. The cohort comport many steps before reaching its end and Genesis is the icebreaker. For this first two weeks of the cohort we were ask to make a website for a fictitious company called ***Rocket Elevators***.

## My Thought Process

3, 2, 1, GO ! Now where to start? What template should I use? What style am I going for? And most importantly where do I found a good source of information?

Those will certainly be some of the questions you'll be asking your self when starting to code a project like this one, and keep in mind that you are limited by time. So my answer for all this, a good search engine : [Google](https://www.google.com/), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and many more.

## Design

So after looking at the template, I've decided to go for a design that was not overcharge (opinion can differ from one to a other). I've also try to keep the design similar between all the page of my site. The red was my preferred choice for the main color throughout the site.

## Server Feature

### WARNING

**The server might be asleep after a period of inactivity. To shake it back alive you have to send at least 2 to 5 requests before it successfully sends a response, and the response might take about 15sec "ish"**

My web application was done using the following:

 - [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
 - [Express](https://app.serverless.com/?package=express-starter/)
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

There is the link for the repo that show you how I've done my Node.js implementation : [Server](https://github.com/ricoloic/server-express-REDP)
